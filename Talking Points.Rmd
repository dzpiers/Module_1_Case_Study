# Talking points

Assume wholesale to be customers spending over $1000 (by inspection, likely a conservative estimate)
86.8% of income from wholesale
No amazon fee confirmed
More stable income, can arrange consistent yearly transactions
81% of wholesale from UK, expand into Europe, framework already there from Netherlands and similar market
List competitors and any relevant details

Graph of wholesale by region
Graph of wholesale revenue vs retail revenue

### Intro work
What is the problem?
Sales too low vs other companies
Sales not enough in certain periods
Some products not selling well?


Why we are giving those recommendations?

How are we are going to cover this today?
Signpost recommendations then pass over to Faye

Need to point out the problem and pain to persuade (start or before recommendation)

Redo slides

### Graph stuff
Graph countries excluding UK as well

### LOOK INTO COMPETITORS

### Proposals to group
Cut slides 3-5, 9
Adjust pricing strategy?

### Problems
Incurral of high and somewhat avoidable costs
Changing digital landscape -> reconsider marketing strategies
Competitors strong (need more wholesale)
Business too reliant on UK sales
